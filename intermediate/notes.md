### Simple Server Setup

We need to start up a local development server to serve static files like our JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets and CSV data.

##### Step 1

Open up a command prompt.

##### Step 2

Navigate to the directory where you downloaded and unzipped this repository. You'll use the command `cd <folder path>` to navigate the directory tree. (Helpful hint: `cd ..` takes you back up the directory tree one folder.) For example, if you unzipped this directory in a folder called `my_folder`:

```
$ cd my_folder/nicar-d3-2017/basic
```

##### Step 3

Start your simple server from the directory.

Python 2.x
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Python 3.x

```
python -m http.server
```

**Good to go!**
